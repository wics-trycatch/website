      title: "Code in Motion: Programming Sony Toio Robots with Unity",
      description: "In this interactive workshop, students will learn how to bring robots to life with code! Using Sony Toio robots and Unity, participants will get hands-on experience writing simple C# scripts to control real robots. Starting with the basics of moving, turning, and looping, students will then work in teams to design fun robot challenges â€” from choreographed dances to obstacle courses. By the end, they'll see how their code directly shapes the robots' behavior, giving them a taste of both game development and robotics programming. No prior coding experience is required; just curiosity and creativity!",

In this workshop, students will dive into Figma, an industry-standard design tool, and design their first mobile app prototype. Participants will create a set of three connected screens. Along the way, they'll learn the basics of user interface (UI) design, explore how to make clickable prototypes, and share their creations. ",

      title: "Sentiment Classifiers with Machine Learning Workshop (Intermediate)",
      description: " Can a computer really read feelings? Think about the last time you left a review on a product...what if a computer could instantly understand your mood just from the words you typed? We can tackle that challenge using the power of Machine Learning, and in this workshop, you'll learn how it works. Just like how humans learn from experience, machines learn from data. Using a dataset with real Amazon reviews, you'll train a supervised learning classifier to predict whether text is positive or negative. We'll warm up with Python basics, then dive into vectorization, model training, and testing accuracy. As one of our more advanced workshops, it pushes your skills beyond coding into real-world AI applications. By the end, you'll have built your own sentiment analysis classifier and sharpened both coding and problem-solving skills!",

Since 2022, I've been teaching coding with organizations like Code Ninjas and SFU Science Alive, as well as leading workshops at hackathons and outreach events on topics from robotics to web development. Last summer, I completed AI4Good Lab, a 7-week AI/ML bootcamp where I built and presented a machine learning project in Montreal. That experience opened my eyes to the endless possibilities of AI/ML and I can't wait to share this passion with you through our Machine Learning workshop! Outside of coding, I love playing guitar, engaging in multimedia, and doing anything with friends (badminton, karaoke, board/card games, ROBLOX, really anything!)."
