      "Hello Try/Catchers!! My name is Archita, and I’m a fourth-year CS student concentrating in AI/ML with a minor in Statistics. I was previously a Technical Executive at WICS, where I hosted technical events for women and non-binary students in CS. Outside of school, I’ve been fortunate learn about AI/ML through 4 industry internships and academic research at SFU, UBC, and UofT. I am mostly interested in the intersection of AI and Medicine, but recently I’ve also been exploring Operating Systems, Biomedical Engineering, and Medical Robotics. In my free time, I love going on runs, hanging out with friends, and listening to music. I’m super excited to meet you all at SFU, and I hope you have the best time at Try/Catch 2025!"

      "Hi, I’m Christina. I’m in my fourth year in Interactive Arts and Technology at SFU, but I previously graduated from BCIT’s Computer Systems Technology program. I’ve been working in tech since 2020, contracting for and interning at startups as well as larger tech companies like Electronic Arts, SAP, and Asana. In my spare time, I like eating chicken katsu, reading fantasy books, and tending to my farm in Stardew Valley. Feel free to hit me up if you have any questions about design internships, font pairings, and everything in between."

      "Hey there! I’m Song, a 4th year Computer Science student at SFU. Throughout my time here, I’ve explored different areas of CS- from interning as a fullstack developer, to researching security vulnerabilities with LLMs at SFU’s Reliable Systems Lab, to my current role as a Software Engineer Intern working on AI/ML R&D at a cybersecurity startup. In my first year, I founded the Developers and Systems Club, which hosts industry talks, workshops, and hackathons for programmers of all levels, and has since grown to over 400 members! With WiCS, I’ve hosted fullstack workshops and taken part in the mentorship program as both a mentee and mentor. Outside of school, I enjoy hackathons, coding, DJing, and going to concerts. I’m so excited to be at Try/CATCH this year and can’t wait to meet everyone <3"
